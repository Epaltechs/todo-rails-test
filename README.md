### Basic Requirements
The goal is to provide a functional To-Do list application that meets the following requirements:

1. Users should be able to create lists that have a title and a collection of tasks.

Aside from premade 3rd party libraries, the application should be **_all your own work_**, and it does not need to be complicated.
